# Meteor Defence
*The challenge was to remake a game I'd never played before*

> You have been warned of an impending meteor shower that will wipe humanity off the face of the earth. 
> You just managed to get to Missile Command and get your station set up, with ten seconds to spare...

## Overview

This is a small game with no end. You survive for as long as you can against the onslaught of a Meteor shower, protecting the people of your world.

You have at your disposal three Gun Turrets to help you in this. They fire big ol' missiles that have been specically designed to destroy a meteor with even a glancing hit.

Upon destruction, Meteors will split into teeny little chunks. These chunks will burn up in the atmosphere, but can still damage buildings if they get too low.

## Your Buildings

The **Gun Turrets** are the extension of your will. They enable you to defence yourself by sending missiles towards the Meteors.

Each Gun Turret has a **Factory** making ammunition. Unfortunately there's only enough room for 10 missiles for each Gun Turret, but if the number of stocked missiles falls beneath 10, and there is still a Factory standing, the hard-working people there will make more.

The **Tracking Radar** gives you information on the paths of each Meteor, showing their heading, and the **Targetting Radar** shows you where your Gun Turrets are aiming.
If your radars are destroyed, you will no longer have this information, and your job will be that much harder.

The **Cities** are what you are trying to defend. The entire population has been evacuated to these cities, for a better change of survival. If all these cities fall, you have failed.

## Controls

`Escape` pauses the game, as does `p` and `Space`.
`Tab` toggles the display of the health of your buildings.
`Control + W`, `Control + Q` and `Alt + F4` all close the game.

The numbers `1` through `3` toggle control to that turret, if it's still standing.
You can also scroll with the mouse wheel to select the Gun Turret on either side of the currently selected one.

Left clicking the mouse fires the currently controlled turret, if it has the ammo.
